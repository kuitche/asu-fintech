# BLOCKCHAIN & CRYPTOCURRENCIES: CROSS-BORDER PAYMENTS & REMIRRANCES

## Introduction

Blockchain is a distributed and decentralized encrypted database that allows for the secure, transparent, and immutable storage of data.
A blockchain consists of a series of blocks, which are records of data that are chained together using cryptography. Each block contains a timestamp and a link to the previous block, forming a chain. This chain of blocks is distributed across a network of computers, known as nodes, which work together to validate and record transactions.
One key feature of blockchain technology is **decentralization**: The blockchain network is a peer-to-peer decentralized network. The peers, aka nodes, are connected to this network in a synchronous way. The nodes can be a desktop, a laptop, a mobile phone, a mining rig, servers, or any other electronic devices. These nodes form the foundation of the blockchain network. They provide computing resources like disk storage space to keep the network alive and to maintain its integrity and security, and they do it voluntarily.
Another feature of the blockchain is that all participants in the network do not need to establish any trust relationships to perform transactions. It relies on **cryptographic authentication technology**, a decentralized network, and a **consensus mechanism** to ensure the security and integrity of funds and information. Thus, ensuring high transparency and security of information on the network.

The key difference between the decentralized per-to-peer network and the traditional centralized client-server network is that the latter has an authoritative central point of control; which is prone to the vulnerability of a single point of failure. If a node in a blockchain is hacked, only the data belonging to that node would be compromised while all other nodes would keep a copy of the ledger. Moreover, the cryptographic hashing algorithm makes it extremely difficult to hack the blockchain.

To ensure the nodes are motivated to maintain the network, blockchain incentivizes the nodes through a mechanism known as mining. By engaging in mining activities, the successful miners will be rewarded with cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum or other coins.

A blockchain is comprised of a chronological chain of blocks. The first block is known as the genesis block. A block refers to a set of transactions that are bundled together and appended to the blockchain. The second block is appended to the genesis block, the third block is appended to the second block, etc.

A block consists mainly of the block header containing metadata and a list of transactions appended to the block header. Transactions include rewards, transaction fees, etc.



Cryptocurrency is a digital currency that uses cryptography for security and is decentralized, meaning it is not controlled by any government or financial institution. It is a type of digital currency and is also classified as an alternative currency and virtual currency.
Cryptocurrencies use decentralized technology to allow for secure financial transactions, asset transfer verification, and the creation of new units.
The first and well known crypto is Bitcoin, which was created in 2009. As of January 2023, there are over 21,910 different cryptocurrencies, with a total market capitalization of over $850 billion.
Some of the factors that contribute to the value of a cryptocurrency are its utility (can it be used to perform functions that are valuable to users?), its scarcity (does it have a limited supply?), and the demand (high demand would drive up the price).

Although Bitcoin was the first application of Blockchain, the idea of creating a digital money without a trusted third party was not conceived by the creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto. It was proposed by Wei Dai and Nick Szabo more than a decade before the successful launch of Bitcoin.
The biggest issue surrounding the implementation of a decentralized digital currency was double spending: where the same currency can be spent more than once.
Wei Dai, a computer engineer and cypherpunk, tried to solve the double spending issue by publishing a paper on cryptocurrency with the title “b-money, an anonymous, distributed electronic cash system” in 1998.
In the same year, Szabo designed a mechanism for a decentralized digital currency called “Bit Gold”. 
Though Bit Gold was never implemented, it has been called a direct precursor to the Bitcoin architecture.
Satoshi sent an email to Wei Dai in 2008 to announce that he had solved the double-spending issue and was ready to implement the first decentralized digital cash without the need of a trusted third party. And on October 31, 2008, he published the Bitcoin whitepaper titled [Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf).

To address the double-spending issue, Satoshi used a combination of digital signatures and a peer-to-peer distributed timestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions (aka proof of work or PoW), in a process known as mining.

Following the creation of Bitcoin, several alternative cryptocurrencies or “altcoins” were created with various modifications and improvements of the original Bitcoin codebase. These include Ethereum, Litecoin, etc.

Cryptocurrency may revolutionize the way cross-border payments and remittances are conducted.
Traditional methods of cross-border payments, such as wire transfers, can be slow and costly. Cryptocurrency has the potential to reduce the cost of remittances, specially for migrants sending money back to their home countries and could potentially increase financial inclusion in developing countries. One company that believes that the ***true power of the modern digital economy can only be unlocked when value flows unencumbered around the globe*** is **Ripple**. 


## Overview and Origin

### Name of company, incorporation, and founders

Suppose you need to send money abroad. As it turns out, it can actually be faster if you personally travel with a suitcase of money instead of going through the current system which uses technology developed in the 1970s. The most common method for US businesses to move funds across borders is SWIFT, which takes a considerable amount of both time and money. This is one of the many areas where Ripple ais making improvements.
Ripple is a blockchain-based payment network that is designed to facilitate global financial transactions. It is used by banks and financial institutions to transfer funds and settle transactions quickly and securely. It is ISO 20022 compliant, which makes it easier for financial institutions to integrate into their existing systems.
The native cryptocurrency of the Ripple network, XRP, is used to facilitate transactions on the platfform. 
Ripple was founded in 2012 by Chris Larsen and Jed McCaleb as an alternative to the slow, costly, and often unreliable methods of making international money transfers.
In 2013, Ripple introduces it digital asset and cryptocurrency XRP with a launch of 100 billion XRP; intended to provide a trusted, distributed ledger that allows for secure money transfers in any currency.

### How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ripple_Labs) provides the following history for Ripple:
> blockquote
Ryan Fugger conceived Ripple in 2004 after working on a local exchange trading system in Vancouver. The intent was to create a monetary system that was decentralized and could effectively empower individuals and communities to create their own money. Fugger later built the first iteration of this system, RipplePay.com. Concurrently, in May 2011, Jed McCaleb began developing a digital currency system in which transactions were verified by consensus among members of the network, rather than by the mining process used by Bitcoin. In August 2012, Jed McCaleb hired Chris Larsen and they approached Ryan Fugger with their digital currency idea. After discussions with McCaleb and long-standing members of the Ripple community, Fugger handed over the reins. In September 2012, Chris Larsen and Jed McCaleb co-founded the corporation OpenCoin. OpenCoin began development of the ripple protocol (RTXP) and the Ripple payment and exchange network. On April 11, 2013, OpenCoin announced it had closed an angel round of funding with several venture capital firms. That same month, OpenCoin acquired SimpleHoney to help it popularize virtual currencies and make them easier for average users. On September 26, 2013, OpenCoin officially changed its name to Ripple Labs, Inc. On October 6, 2015, the company was rebranded from Ripple Labs to Ripple

### How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

Ripple is a privately funded company.
Ripple's revenue sources include professional services provided to financial network operators being integrated with Ripple, software built to integrate legacy financial systems with Ripple and the native currency (XRP). The primary source of funding Ripple has been sales of the XRP cryptocurrency. According to its own records it sold $1,254.54 million worth of XRP between Q4 2016 and Q2 2020.
In April & May 2013, Ripple closed two rounds of Angel funding totaling $5.5M from eight investors. In November 2013, Ripple raised $3.5M in seed funding from Core Innovation Capital, Venture51, Camp One Ventures, and IDG Capital Partners.
According to [Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ripple-labs/company_financials),
Ripple has raised a total of $293.8M in funding over 14 rounds. Their latest funding was raised on Aug 21, 2021 from a Series B round. Ripple is currently funded by 43 investors. Uday Kumar Bangalore Shivaraman and Azure Ventures Group are the most recent investors.
Ripple has raised a total of $300M across 2 funds, their latest being Ripple Fund. This fund was announced on Sep 29, 2021 and raised a total of $250M.
Ripple has made 28 investments. Their most recent investment was on Nov 30, 2022, when Keyrock raised $72M.
Ripple has made 3 diversity investments. Their most recent diversity investment was on Jan 1, 2022, when Web3 Pro™ raised $4.7M.
There has been 3 exits: MoneyGram International, Keyless, and Tranglo.
Ripple has made one acquisition, SimpleHoney, on Apr 3, 2013.


## Business Activities:

### What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

Cross-border money trasfer is a huge market. Due to the large number of intermediate links, the cost of cross-border remittances is high, and the average commission rate per remitter is as high as 7.68%. In addition, the remittance cycle is long, from a few days to weeks or even months. Cross-border remittances are also susceptible to fraud.
The high cost of remittances comes mainly from fees levied by SWIFT, the global Interbank Financial Telecommunication Association.  It is responsible for providing financial messaging service (FTS) to the global banking and financial industry.
The Swift system was established in the 1970s. Although it was efficient and fast at the time, it is clearly antiquated and cumbersome in the Internet Informage ages. Credit Suisse said in a report that the old Swift has many security risks, and 6.1 billion financial messages are sent out every year, which is costly with an average rate of 10%.
Ripple aims to be *redefining the way that value moves around the world* by providing a blockchain-based technology that streamlines and accelerates the transfer of funds across country borders. It allows banks to connect directly through its global, real-time settlement network (known as **RippleNet**). Ripple allows banks to continue to use the standard messaging types for communication between them. However, as it connects banks ledgers directly, it adds value by enabling payments to settle in minutes, if not seconds, at lower costs while reducing operating expenditure and freeing up liquidity.

### Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

According to World Bank statistic, the scale of global cross-border payments has grown at an average annual rate of 5%. It reached $613 billion in 2017 and $642 billion in 2018; peaking at US$156 trillion by 2022.
Of this total:
* Business-to-business (B2B) transactions account for the largest share by far, expected to account for US$150 trillion.
* Consumer-to-Business (C2B) transactions, such as global e-commerce and offline travel spending, are forecast to reach US$2.8 billion
* Business-to-Consumer (B2C) transactions, including wages or interest payments, are expected to amount to US$1.6 billion by 2022.
* Consumer-to-consumer (C2C), or payment by remittance, contributes the least - projected to reach US$0.8 billion by 2022

Ripple has been designed to cater to major banks and financial institutions and make cross-border payments quicker and faster, addressing a major issue for banks that move significant amounts of money across borders everywhere. Ripple enables the transfer of these funds at significantly lower fees and almost instantaneously. This B2B model represents the major share of the cross-border payments/remittances domain. 

Three keys differentiators give Ripple an unfair advantage over main competitors:
* Working capital savings 
* Faster payment settlement times with fewer failures
* Competitive foreign exchange rates and payout fees / lower cost of cross-border payments

### Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

The Ripple system uses the distributed ledger technology (DLT) to process transactions,  which allows banks to bypass third parties and instead trade bank-to-bank.
Ripple’s payment protocol (the Ripple Protocol Consensus Algorithm) uses proof-of-correctness (POC), a consensus mechanism that’s based on majority validation, which means, in order to maintain, verification and consensus of the network, the POC is applied every few seconds by all nodes.
[Arjun Chand, April 2021](https://arjunnchand13.medium.com/all-you-need-to-know-about-ripple-xrp-products-users-utility-target-markets-607b21e41c04) provides the below description of Ripple's technology implementation.
```
Essentially, Ripple has two separate components: XRP and RippleNet. RippleNet is a payment network designed for enterprises whereas XRP is a cryptocurrency that acts as the fuel that runs the network.   
Ripple’s different components include XRP Ledger (XRPL), XRP, RippleNet, and RippleX.   
XRP Ledger is an open-source, decentralized and permissionless blockchain technology. It has the capacity to settle transactions within 3–5 seconds and can settle 1500 transactions per second. It works like a distributive economic system that stores all the information of the XRP users and also offers an exchange service for multiple currency pairs. It allows for real-time financial transactions which are secured and validated by participants on the network through a consensus mechanism. It is managed by a network of independent validating nodes that compare their transaction records with each other continuously and ensure that they are the same.   
XRP is an independent digital asset that is built for payments. It is the native cryptocurrency of Ripple and is the native digital asset on the XRP ledger. XRP along with the XRP ledger is used to power innovative technology across the payments space. They are faster, less costly and more scalable than any other digital asset. Ripple focuses on building technology that would help unleash new utility for XRP and transform global payments. It is also used by third-parties for other related use cases.    
RippleNet was built by Ripple Labs on top of XRPL. It is a payment and exchange network. It allows customers to use XRP for sourcing liquidity in cross-border transactions, instead of pre-funding. This provides RippleNet customers with an instant settlement, lower exchange fees and an opportunity to use working capital more efficiently. RippleNet comprises 3 products that are designed as a suite that acts as a payment solution systems for financial institutions. This 3 product-suite consists of the following components:   
1. xRapid: an On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) solution. It uses XRP as a global bridge between different fiat currencies. Just like XRP, xRapid depends on the XRP Ledger that enables faster validation and settlement times in comparison to other conventional methods.
2. xCurrent: Ripple’s enterprise software solution. It is designed to provide banks with instant settlements of cross-border payments with end-to-end tracking. It enables financial institutions to message each other in real-time in order to confirm the details of the payment before initiating the transaction and confirming the delivery. Primarily designed for fiat currencies, xCurrent also supports transactions made using cryptocurrencies. It is not based on the XRP Ledger and does not use XRP cryptocurrency by default. It is built around the Interledger Protocol (ILP) which is a protocol that connects different payment networks.
3. xVia: an API-based standardized interface enables financial institutions to interact within a single framework. It allows financial institutions to connect with other financial institutions on RippleNet and create payments. It also allows them to attach invoices or other information to their transactions. It enables financial institutions to access the utility of RippleNet.    
RippleX is Ripple’s open developer platform for money. The RippleX platform provides developers with tools, services and programs that can be used to integrate money into apps. With the help of RippleX projects, developers can use XRP and its underlying technology in use cases from micropayments to e-commerce to exchanges and peer-to-peer services.   
```

## Landscape:

### What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

Ripple is in the Cross-border payments domain.
A cross-border payment refers to any transaction in which the payer and the payee are located in different countries; these transactions can take place between individuals, companies and banking institutions.
The entire purpose of cross-border payments are to help merchants adapt their global commerce strategy to local markets; by offering consumers in different regions payment options familiar to them, merchants can both enhance the customer experience and capitalize on new revenue streams.
Cross-border payments take many forms, including: Bank transfers, International wire transfers, Electronic funds transfers, Digital currencies, Digital wallets, Mobile wallets, Blockchain-based payments, Cash-based payments.
Ripple technology and global network enable remittances, SME payments, disbursements and treasury flows that are faster, more reliable and more affordable for organizations and their customers.

### What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
Per [Phillip Zilter, Feb 2022](https://www.compareremit.com/news/6-big-trends-in-the-cross-border-payments-industry-for-2022/):
The global cross-border trade is expected to grow 5% (CAGR) between 2018 and 2022
There are three major trends towards cross-border payments fintech:   
**Trend 1:** Changing consumer exigencies within payments market    
The growing growth of the money transfer market is closely linked to the needs of consumers that are changing and evolving towards digital. Consumers are less willing to pay for banking services while expecting them to be quick and intuitive. The increasing penetration of smartphones and the proliferation of digital hotspots as alternative payment methods (APMs) for money transfers and online purchases have created new demands that incumbents struggling to find answers Alternative payment solutions providers that offer faster, cheaper and more transparent cross-border payment solutions can gain a competitive advantage over with traditional banks.    
**Trend 2:** Increased trade with emerging money transfer markets   
A key trend in the cross-border payments industry is an increasing focus on emerging markets in Africa, Latin America and Asia Pacific, as their share of international transactions increases. Overall, international trade is expected to grow by around 5% (CAGR) from 2018 to 2022, with the majority coming from emerging markets, where growth is estimated at around 11% (CAGR) between 2018 and 2022, driven by initiatives such as the Africa Continental Free Trade Area and China's Belt and Road Initiative. By contrast, protectionist policies in developed markets, including Brexit and US trade tensions, are expected to slow growth to around 2% (CAGR) from 2018 to 2022 within the cross-border payments market size.    
**Trend 3:** Accessibility of mobile phones and electronic cross-border payments
As mobile phone ownership increases, more people around the world have access to banking services and electronic cross-border payment solutions. Mobile phone ownership among adults in emerging economies has increased to around 83% (PEW Research), while promoting financial inclusion - in 2017, 69% of the world population with a bank account and/or mobile wallet, up from 62% in 2014 (World Bank).   
This number is expected to grow in the coming years with the mobile wallet forecast to grow significantly. The use of global mobile wallets at point of sale (POS) is expected to change from c. 22% in 2019 to c. 30% by 2023, while the use of mobile wallets in e-commerce is forecast to increase to more than half (about 52%) by 2023, from c. 42% in 2019 to c. 52% in 2023 (Worldpay). This growth is increasing the volume of trade across the globe. Together, these trends create the need for new business models and value propositions that address existing process bottlenecks with correspondent banks.

These trends and the traditional pain points around cross-border payment companies – delays, high costs and lack of transparency - have led to the emergence of two new specialized groups of players: digitally-enabled money transfer operators and back-end systems.    
Digital Support Remittance market Operators deal directly with the sender - the consumer or the seller - and make digital cross-national payments their core business. When working with liquid currency pairs (e.g. USD/EUR), these providers often establish direct banking relationships in sending and receiving countries, with net payments circulating between these countries. However, in many emerging markets, setting up a bank account can be a challenge, and capital controls often impede payment flows. Financial inclusion in these countries also tends to be lower, and payment methods are highly fragmented. These conditions mean that digital money transfer operators often depend on partners, such as back-end infrastructure providers, in these countries.    
Back-end cross-border payment networks: With the current cross-border payments fintech, there is no direct relationship with the sender or receiver, but instead cooperates with their banks or wallet providers. By establishing a partner network through direct connection with local banks and APM in both liquid and illiquid markets, the backend network enables interoperability in payments beyond boundaries. For example, a Paypal account can transfer a deposit in Euros to an M-Pesa account in Kenia Schilling. As this is not possible with CBN, front-end vendors are increasingly using these alternative backside networks instead of using traditional banking rails. The high fragmentation of the global payments industry and different regulatory requirements mean that back-end networks are often concentrated in certain countries or regions. As a result, a sending partner, such as an MTO, will need to connect to several back-end networks to provide a truly global solution to customers.    
In the cross-border payment networks, back-end networks often use an aggregation model. Aggregation of payments reduces costs, as most fees are incurred as a flat fee per transaction. In addition, to enable real-time payment confirmation, logistics providers often require pre-payback to their sending partners as collateral. This advance payback of the sending partner allows logistics providers to credit the recipient's account in real time after the transaction has been initiated.
This aggregate transnational business model is especially applicable to transactions in the C2C, C2B and B2C segments, which are often low value. Back-end structures can settle these transactions faster, cheaper, and more transparently than transactions handled by CBNs.     
Aggregate models are less successful in the B2B segment, where the average cross-border transaction value is typically higher than $50,000. Ensuring the ability to repay such high values upfront would require depositors to significantly increase their working capital requirements. These models also offer less potential for cost reduction, as current unit economics for B2B transactions are better, due to higher mean and fixed nature of fees. For these reasons, almost all high-value B2B cross-border payments are still processed through CBN.

## Results

### What has been the business impact of this company so far?
According to [Ripple] website, their major impact has been the *Global collaboration for a more equitable, sustainable and inclusive economy*.   
It boosted partnerships with innovative fintechs, universities, NGOs, foundations, and social entrepreneurs to make progress towards a more open and meaningfully connected world.   
The partnership between Ripple and Santander, which began in 2018, is one of the most visible example in the financial sector.   
In addition to providing financial institutions and other businesses with access to new markets, XRP's quick and cheap payment settlement allow transactions such as wire transfers to be completed in a matter of seconds rather than days.   

There has been significant progress in the usage of blockchain-enabled solutions recently. XRP is altering the global monetary system. A pioneer in blockchain-enabled payments, RippleNet, acts as a solid alternative to SWIFT GPI. Although SWIFT GPI and RippleNet provide instant payments, the latter also offers instant settlement and accepts fiat and cryptocurrencies. However, RippleNet remains in an early stage of adoption.   
SWIFT has understood that it needs to adopt new technologies to compete in a rapidly evolving payments market. It has collaborated with R3, a blockchain enterprise software firm, on the Corda Settler platform, leading to the launch of ***SWIFT Go*** for low-value cross-border payments in seconds.

### What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

One of the key metrics used to measure success is the extend to which it is adopted by major corporations and financial institutions, reflected in the partnerships secured; and the value of the native token. Other metrics include market cap, growth rate, etc.      
XRP has seen widespread adoption from a variety of finantial institutions due to its many advantages in facilitating cross-border payments. Many banks see XRP as a viable option because of its low fees and quick payment settlement process; as well as because it allows them to expand into new markets.



### How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

Ripple main competitor in the domain is Stellar, an initial fork from Ripple (Native token: Lumens or XLM), created by one Ripple's co-founder.  
Ripple and Stellar are two of the biggest payment-focused cryptocurrencies in the world. 

* Market Cap 

Ripple’s XRP has a market cap of over $25 billion while Stellar’s XLM is valued at over $2.5 billion.    
Lumens is now a multi-billion-dollar coin, having reached heights of $13 billion in December 2017. Its most impressive achievement so far is the partnership it formed with IBM. The deal officially went live in March 2018 and will allow IBM to easily move funds between banks in the South Pacific. If successful, it is expected that it will expand to other regions. If Stellar Lumens can form more partnerships like the one with IBM, there is a good chance it will continue to rise in value.   

As of April 2018, Ripple was the third most valuable cryptocurrency available, way behind Ethereum but way ahead of Bitcoin Cash! Interestingly, for a short period of time in late 2017, Ripple overtook Ethereum to become the number 2 coin, however, this has since reversed.
Ripple has formed even more important partnerships. In fact, they have tested their distributed ledger technology with over 100 different banks, including UBS and Santander!

* Adoption   

Stellar is a blockchain project that makes it possible for people to store and move money. It has a platform that enables people to create digital representations of money like pesos and US dollars. Stellar is mostly used by fintech and other money transfer companies like MoneyGram and Wyre.      
USD Coin is one of the biggest use-case of Stellar. It was used by Circle to build its stabilized USDC, which is one of the most popular stablecoins in the world, with over  $45 billion in market cap.   
A key challenge for Stellar is that Binance, the biggest exchange in the world, converted its USDC balances to Binance USD. At the same time, plans by Circle to go public in New York stalled. 

While the XRP coin has underperformed the S&P 500 and Dow Jones, it has done better than most cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Stellar, and Ethereum. It has risen by more than 73% from its lowest level that year.    
XRP has also risen because of partnerships amid the ongoing cases. For example, in October 2022, it partnered with companies like I-Remit and LemonWay, a leading payment in France and Sweden. 
Therefore, there is a likelihood that the XRP price will continue rising.    
However, in December 2020, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against Ripple Labs Inc. and two of its executives, alleging that they raised over $1.3B through an unregistered securities offering in the form of their digital currency, XRP. The case is still ongoing and the outcome might affect the future growth of XRP.

* Native cryptocurrency Price history

The first few years of Stellar’s existence, XLM traded at a fraction of a cent for the first two years or so, with no significant price movement until 2017. After a short bull run in the summer of that year, the price of XLM suddenly skyrocketed in November/December, reaching an all-time high of $0.93 by January 2018.  
The record price wasn’t to hold long. XLM experienced a significant downturn throughout 2018, with prices tanking by around 90%. By February of 2019, the token was trading at just $0.06. There was little improvement that year either, with XLM barely scraping a high of just $0.16, having dropped as low as $0.03.    
Stellar looked to benefit from the wider crypto market bull at the end of 2020, but the SEC ruling against Ripple caused a huge amount of collateral damage, as investors predicted that a similar decision could be coming Stellar’s way. Having crept up to $0.19, the price of XLM had dropped back to $0.13 by January 2021.
XLM has since recovered well. The second upturn to hit the crypto market saw prices surge across the board - and Stellar was no exception. Prices reached a high of $0.74 in May, before going into decline. XLM closed 2021 trading around $0.27.   
In 2022 crypto market crash pushed the price of XLM down to hit the low of $0.10 in August.   
Currently, as of 27 Feb 2023, XLM is trading around $0.0877.

Ripple’s initial price trajectory looks much the same as that of XLM. Prices remained subdued until 2017, when XRP reached parity with the US dollar, following a spate of adoption by several financial institutions. Prices then surged at the end of the year, finally reaching an all-time high of $3.08 by January 2018.     
Ripple was unable to hold its value for long though, and prices dropped steeply in the opening quarter of 2018. By August, prices had dropped as low as $0.27. Things picked up again in 2019, with XRP reaching a high of $0.46 by the summer, but once again didn't last and prices declined steeply for the remainder of the year.   
Things were looking up for XRP going into 2020, but any price growth was stifled, first by the COVID pandemic then later the SEC ruling. However, XRP seems to have recovered well from what was a very chaotic year. Having traded as low as $0.21 in January 2021, Ripple experienced a major upturn and prices soared to $1.83 in April. After the drop to $0.52 in July, the price of Ripple climbed to $1.38 in September and closed the year trading around $0.84.   
In the first 4 months of 2022 XRP was trading between $0.7 and $1, except for a short drop in the price at the end of January when the price was around $0.6. In the next months, XRP wasn't able to resist the overall bear market and the price dropped to $0.3. In September 2022, the price reached $0.5 and currently (as of 27 Feb 2023), XRP is trading around $0.37.

* Native cryptocurrency Price Prediction

There is a fair amount of optimism regarding Stellar’s price potential. According to TradingBeasts technical analysis, XLM will reach an average price of $0.18 by December 2023, it will start growing month-by-month across 2024 and hit $0.20 by the end of the year.    
DigitalCoinPrice sees Stellar reaching $0.20 before the end of 2023. Looking ahead to 2024, the platform sees XLM reaching $0.26.   
Coinpedia is expecting XLM to reach an average price of $0.21 in 2023, but in long term, the price of XLM will rise up to $0.35 in 2024 and $0.56 in 2025.   
The forecasts for XLM are undoubtedly positive and are highly believable. Naturally, anyone looking to invest in Stellar should align their expectations with the more conservative XLM predictions, but adding the token to your portfolio could well prove a smart decision.

Ripple’s ongoing legal battle with the SEC has led to many leading analysts having to revisit their XRP predictions. However, a degree of optimism seems to have returned with regards to Ripple’s future as an investment opportunity.   
DigitalCoinPrice is just one platform predicting growth for XRP in 2023. The platform’s technical analysis has XRP hitting a high of $1 before the year is out.    
Wallet Investor also sees XRP reaching $1 in 2023 and $1.5 by the end of 2025.     
TradingBeasts predicts XRP to reach an average price of $0.63 in 2023 and 0.76 in 2025.

* Regulatory Concerns

Ripple is currently in the midst of an SEC court battle. The SEC has alleged Ripple unlawfully sold securities during its XRP ICO. According to the most recent reports, the firm is prepared to argue “The Fair Notice” defense. This strategy argues the firm had no reasonable fair notice from the SEC on whether selling XRP would constitute an illegal securities offering.   
If Ripple (XRP) is successful in its argument, the effects would have a “ripple” effect throughout the industry. Moving forward, the SEC would have to prove they warned ICOs that their efforts could be considered illegal to impose harsh fines. Speaking on the company’s future plans, Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlighaus has stated that his firm intends to consider going public following the resolution of the SEC lawsuit.

Of course, the experience and insight gained by McCaleb during his stint at Ripple paid off greatly in terms of regulatory concerns. To date, Stellar has managed to remain out of the SEC’s crosshairs. Notably, the platform even received regulatory approval from the New York Department of Financial Services to be listed.
In September 2022, Stellar Lumens raised eyebrows across the market when it announced that it had partnered with VISA, Tala, and Circle, one of the companies behind USDC, to create a new decentralized ecosystem. The team will create a new stablecoin and wallet that will enable users to make cross-border transactions and access fiat to crypto services.



## Recommendations

### If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!); and Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

Ripple has focused so far on the B2B segment of the domain. Many people in developing countries lack access to banks and other financial institutions; leaving a huge segment of the population untaped. Adding a B2C and C2C would greatly complement existing services. This is why its main competitor's mission has been to *target developing markets and facilitate money remittances and bank loan distribution to the unbanked*.   
Also, Ripple does not pay any rewards for adding new blocks to the blockchain. They believe that incentives tend to warp the behavior of validators, but instead, the incentive for validators should be to preserve the stability, reliability, and integrity of the Ripple network. This has also led to fewer validators, as there isn’t a financial incentive to run a Ripple validator unless you are an active user of the ecosystem. The cost of running a computer as a validating network node may deter Ripple network users from running nodes.   
Incentivising validators will increase validators and add robustness to the ecosystem.

### What technologies would this additional product or service utilize and why?
In order to achieve B2C or C2C transactions, the company would need to implement a mechanism for high transaction throughput. The Stellar's Consensus Protocol (SCP) algorithm called the “Federated Byzantine Agreement” can be leveraged to that end.   
Ripple is a blockchain-based network; meaning adding incentives might not require additional technology.
